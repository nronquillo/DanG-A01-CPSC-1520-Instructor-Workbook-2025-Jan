# Agenda

> ***NOTE:** This agenda is copied from the previous term and needs to be adjusted to this semester. Otherwise, the topics are generally in the correct order.*

> These are my notes on what I plan to teach in each [**upcoming class**](#feb-11-w06).
>
> ###### *... Warn those who are idle ..., encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.*
>
> > My philosophy of teaching, taken from [the source](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1TH.5.14.NIV)


> ## Starter Kits
>
> To grab a starting point for any in-class demos or practices, you can use [**tiged**](https://github.com/tiged/tiged) (based on [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) by Rich Harris, creator of Svelte). It will allow you to grab a copy of the starter kit folder to put into your student workbook.
> 
> You will need to have `pnpm` installed and working on your computer. Run the following code in the terminal from the **root** of your repository:
>
> ```bash
> pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force dgilleland/CPSC-1520-Workbook/sk/-how-to- ./src/-how-to-
> ```
>
> ***Note:** You may need to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to stop the `pnpm tlx tiged` command after it has finished downloading the demo folder.*

- **Today** *(Online)*
  - [ ] Characteristics of JavaScript
    - case-sensitive
    - **not** a type-safe language
    - looks a lot like C#, but has a number of differences
    - string literals can be wrapped in double or single quotes
    - string interpolation is performed with text inside a pair of back-ticks (`` ` ``)
      - placeholders in the form of `${expression}`
      - e.g.: `` `The count is ${count}` ``
  - [ ] ***Variables***
  - [ ] The browser's dev tools provides a **console** that is a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) environment for JavaScript

- **Homework**


## Jan 31

- **Today**
  - [ ] **In-Class Lab 3** (Functions and Events)

> ### Lab 3 Spec Notes
> 
> - **Step 2** - The first point is somewhat vague - which element (there are two)? But, from reading the rest of the steps and seeing the sample screenshot, it would seem that the element is the `divElement`
> - **Step 3** - The instructions are somewhat vague, but get a bit clearer when you look closely at the HTML. One of the parts of this step refers to the "div list group", and that appears to be the same element as the first `divElement` selected in Step 1 (though we selected it by the class '.javascript-resources' and not '.list-group' as somewhat inferred by these instructions).
> - **Step 4** - The instructions mention "the list", and that is (once again), the `divElement`. However, since it's talking about it as "the list", I will look for it by the class `'.list-group'`.
